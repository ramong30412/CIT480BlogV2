  This week we worked on a git pull request for our cit384 class. One of the problems i ran into was that whenever i pulled or fetched my teammates repo it could only bring the master branch and was not showing any of the other branches. This was a problem because we were working on our secondary branches to develop our assignment so the main branch was still empty, pulling an empty branch into your cli does very little for you. 

  What exactly does a git pull request do? A git pull request allows us to share our progress with others and give them a palace to make changes to our project and discuss/ justify those changes. It keeps a history of these changes and lets you progress the project without having to push it to the main branch or deployment. 

  The first step in the process of sharing your git project with your teammates is navigating to your repository clicking on the branch menu and clicking on pull request then you select the working branch and the branch you want to merge into at the end. In the case of our error sometime when github doesn't pull everything we can solve it with an easy command, *git pull origin branch_name* .
