  Last week we talked about our project and were handed some guidelines. Although not required it was recommended that if you’re all working on a report together it would be smart to create a project board. Project Boards are neat little tools that let you organize project processes, issues that need to be solved and keep track of the stuff you have already solved. It uses a project card format, think something  like post its, and organizes it across columns by category; it also keeps track of pull requests. There are three different types of project boards: User-Owned project boards, organization-wide project boards and Repository project boards. User owned allows you to add issues and pull requests from any of your personal repos, organization-wide allows you add issues and pull requests from any repo belonging to the organization, and lastly repository project boards only allow you add issues and requests from that specific repo. 
  
  To create a user owned project board we need to go to our github profile, we'll see multiple tabs starting with overview, then repos, and a project tab. Hit the project tab then it will give you the option to create a new project click on that give the project a name and a brief description. After that it will prompt you for a template where you can choose one that you'd made or continue without one. For the board's visibility, set it to private, then create the project. Once the project is created we need to populate it with columns, simply click on the add column option then give that column a name. You’ll also have an option to automate the column, this gives you three options to do,in progress, and done. Essentially automating it will just mean that as you do the task in that column they'll move around on their own. We choose when things move in the next prompt, workflow automations so for example you choose to do in automation and you want things to move there when added so click on newly added in the workflow automation prompt.
