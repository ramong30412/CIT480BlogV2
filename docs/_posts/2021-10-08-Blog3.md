 Our latest assignment involves creating an ansible playbook and that’s what inspired this week's blog. What is Ansible? Ansible is an opensource tool used for automation. Some of the things we can automate are cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, as well as describe how different parts of your system relate. One of its main advantages, apart from being open source, is that it uses YAML as its language. 
  
An ansible playbook is the blue prints or recipe we can write to tell ansible what to do. We would write one when we want to automate a process or define some configurations. Playbooks are written in YAML syntax, one of the things to look out for here is spacing.Here’s some example code taken from our ansible slides. 

    - hosts: web_server
          Vars:
        - local_dir: “/myapp”
        - dest_dir: “/var/www”
          tasks:
        - name: Install nginx
                   yum: name=nginx.x86_64 state=present

One our playbook is written, to run it all we need to do is run the  *ansible-playbook playbookname * command.
