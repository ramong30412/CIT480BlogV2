I'm currently taking Computer Interaction, a class that focuses on User Interface and User experience when it comes to the development of apps and websites and they recently exposed me to a tool that would benefit anyone in tech even if your main job isn't UI/UX design.  This tool is called Figma, what is figma? Figma is a web based graphics editor and prototyping tool, the uses for it are mostly UI/UX interface design with the option for real time collaboration on such projects. To get started with figma you can sign up for either their free account or paid subscription premium account at their [website](https://www.figma.com/)

How to use Figma.Im going to demo a quick set up for an app on this blog. Once we sign up figma offers us the option to create a document, each document will be called a file by figma, those files will have a canvas and that's where we create our design. Files can be multiple pages and those pages will contain screens. So click on create a file, go to frameworks and click on one of the presets that you want to use. They'll have preset for phones( the specific dimensions for specific brands in this demo we use the iphone 13 frame), Desktops,and tablets.

Once we choose our frame then we have our base to start designing, we will make a simple sign up screen. Weâ€™ll start by picking shapes in a circle to represent where our logo or user profile would go on the screen, Then some text boxes to act as buttons. One neat thing about figma is that you can create a prototype that shows actions between screens, what does this mean. It means that we can make our sign up button on one screen lead to a second screen that would showcase what the next step in the sign up process would look like.

  Here we see that we have a resembalce to the login screen to my favorite music streaming app, spotify. It showcases what login into the app for the first time would look like. We see the sign up button our next step would be to create a screen by using another iphone 13 frame and showcase what the signing up process would looke like, the input options for name,email, and password. Then we would add a prototype animation to show that transition from clicking on sign up to being displayed the sign up screen. You can really go down the stream on how much of the interface you want to display. Hopefully you see the value of figma and implement it in your next project design!
