This Blog was inspired by the second part of our project this semester! In the first part we manually set up a VPC on AWS, this time around we are going to automate that process. Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code software tool, it uses HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON. Terraform allows us to write a file defining the steps and values needed to set up our VPC and when running this file it will do just that, set up the VPC! 
	Before we begin make sure you have terraform downloaded as well as an AWS account. Create a folder for your terraform files, name it something obvious and make sure you know where to find it. Terraform uses file types of .tf or .tfjson format. To create a vpc we need to find the terraform reference for that aws service we do this by going to this link [terraform aws resource site](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs). There we will see some code that looks like this:
       
    terraform {
  	  required_providers {
   	    aws = {
      	  source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      	  version = "~> 3.0"
    	  }
  	  }
    }

    # Configure the AWS Provider
      provider "aws" {
  	    region = "us-east-1"
    }

    # Create a VPC
      resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
 	      cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
    }
    
This technically has the basic instructions to set up your vpc bit it will be just a vpc with nothing in it so let's also create a gateway and a public and private subnet. The gateway will connect our VPC to outside access aka the internet. The subnets will help us control traffic flow and the private one can even be used to push updates to our applicaitons! To set this up scroll down through the link and lookd for the terraform resources needed, add them as you go. This will leave us with some code that looks something like this:

    Create the VPC
    resource "aws_vpc" "Main" {                # Creating VPC here
    cidr_block       = var.main_vpc_cidr     # Defining the CIDR block use 10.0.0.0/24 for demo
    instance_tenancy = "default"
    }
    Create Internet Gateway and attach it to VPC
    resource "aws_internet_gateway" "IGW" {    # Creating Internet Gateway
    vpc_id =  aws_vpc.Main.id               # vpc_id will be generated after we create VPC
    }
    Create a Public Subnets.
    resource "aws_subnet" "publicsubnets" {    # Creating Public Subnets
    vpc_id =  aws_vpc.Main.id
    cidr_block = "${var.public_subnets}"        # CIDR block of public subnets
    }
    Create a Private Subnet                   # Creating Private Subnets
    resource "aws_subnet" "privatesubnets" {
    vpc_id =  aws_vpc.Main.id
    cidr_block = "${var.private_subnets}"          # CIDR block of private subnets
   
   This will give us a vpc creation along witht the subnets and the gateway having said that terraform can only do what you tell it to do. This will still need table assocaitions and a NAT gateway. On top of that we didnt hardcode any of the values here so we need to create a seperate terraform file defining the values for the CIDR values or hardcode the value we want there. Terraform is a very useful tool but it must be used accurately make sure that you feed it the right data and that what you create functions on its own.
