This blog is going to be about HTML and basic structuring practices. What is HTML?HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is essentially what structures all of the content in web pages and has some stylistic purposes but with the existence of CSS it's more about formatting content through the uses of elements and tags so that it has meaning in relation to the content. This blog is less about teaching you html elements and more about teaching you good practices. [To learn more about HTML you can visit this page. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference]

So what are some good practices when it comes to HTML formatting? For starters a good first step is to create a document outline. A document outline is a way to visualize how your page will be structured. For example where do you want your heading section, navigation, the order of the content of your page. You can think of it as a checklist or table of contents.

Another good practice is to know which elements you need to use and when. Some of the common elements are headingsm,article,aside,nav,section and div; these are mostly used to section off portions of your website. Then we have elements like header,main,footer which are used to group up elements in a way that gives them a relationship to the page. The header will typically have stuff like logo,author name,introductory material for your site. The main section is where most of your content is going to be headers and body elements present here. Lastly for your footer you want content like contact form,disclaimers, social media links. Your typical website will look something like `header` section, followed by `nav` then `main` and sections. You should also know about the aside element, a new element added to HTML five very similar to the section element. When would you use something like aside, when that specific content of your page is relevant but not a critical part of your page. Knwoing when to use these lement s is what sepereates good formatting from great formatting.
