<h2> Intro to CSS </h2>

A few weeks ago we did a blog about how to make some good HTML Structures so I thought that a good follow up this week would be to talk about CSS. What is CSS?  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and it is essentially what is used to alter the appearance of websites, think fonts, colors margin and even spacing changes. You could make the headings on a page all pink or separate it so that content is displayed in columns.

So what are some of the basics of CSS? CSS is usually its own page and then that page is applied to your HTML Code. It has two main component selectors and declarations. Selectors is what the part that specifies which part of the HTML code you want the CSS to alter, then the declaration is what the alterations will be. For example we could have something like this:

    h2{
	    Color: green;
	    Font-size: 5em;
    }
    
Here we have our selector, h2, so now its saying go to html doc and change the h2 headings from its default. Then for the declarations those are inside the curly brackets and it's essentially saying hey change it from the default to green letters and a font size of 5em. This is essentially the main concept in CSS there are some 
other neat tricks like in line alterations where you can add CSS directly to the HTML line you want to alter.
