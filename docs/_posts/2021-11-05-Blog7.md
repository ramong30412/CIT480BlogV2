This is a blog about the SQL Language and getting started with it, it was inspired by a group project that we will need. For starters, what is SQL (Structured Query Language), it's essentially a programming language to manipulate data in a database. There are other database languages out there in the world but SQL is the most popular language. Some of the things you can do with SQL are set up databases, create tables within that database, and query/ request information for that database. 

To work with SQL we should download an SQL application, MySQL is the most popular open source application for this. I’m on Windows so we’ll cover how to install MySQL on a Windows Operating System. To download MySQL the simplest method is to download the installer, [SQL Downloader Link](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/). Next you follow the instructions of the installation wizard, agree to the terms the big step is going to be the developer options i would recommend sticking to the default which is labeled developer default. Once youve done that click on execute and the installation will begin, once that it is completed the wizard will have you do some final configurations. Make sure the server configurations are at what you want them then the wizard will do a quick run through your options and make sure the program runs properly, give it a name and click finish you’re done!
