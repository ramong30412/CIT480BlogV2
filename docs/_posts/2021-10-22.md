  On this week's blog we will talk about ec2 instances and how to set one up. An ec2 instance is a virtual server/machine that you can add an OS to as well as set up applications on it. This can be useful when wanting to test out an application or software, as well as for data storage.
  
  To set up an ec2 instance we will need to set up an aws account, we will also have different cost options for our ec2 which essentially give you more computing capacity and more uptime. The free option is more than sufficient to start out and gives you up to 750 hrs a month for up to one year. To launch an ec2 instance we go to our console search of ec2 under services and navigate there. Then we set up a key pair if we haven't already, it will be under ***key pairs***, it's important not to lose our private key at the end of this step so make sure to save the file. Once we have done this we go back to the ec2 console and select launch instance. It will prompt you to choose an AMI Image, here we can select what OS flavor we want as well as the region and zone. We can even create our own custom AMI’s as well.
  
  Once you’ve chosen an AMI then next we need to pick an instance type. This is where you need to decide how much computing power you need, I recommend you start with the micro free tier option. Hit that Review and Launch option next and follow what the configuration wizard asks you to do. The wizard will create a security group for the instance but you can also use existing security groups if you already have them set up. Once you finish with those security group configurations all that’s left is to review the set up one last time and to launch that instance.
