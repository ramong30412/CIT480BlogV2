In a previous Blog we talked about EC2 instances and how to set them up, if you remember we also mentioned Security Group configurations. This blog will cover another aspect of security and that's IAM (Identity and Access Management). What is IAM and what does it do? IAM is an amazon web service that allows an administrator to securely control who can access and who has permissions to activate services within a VPC. Our IAM powers are great and what we do with them will vary depending on the job that you play within the vpc.There are three “jobs” you could be playing: 1)service user, 2) service administrator and 3) IAM administrator. 

Service users if you use the vpc you’re a user, your privileges to services are limited and you don't need to worry about credentials and permissions. If you’re a service administrator then you’re responsible for deciding which vpc services and features your employees should have access to, you would still need to submit a request to the IAM administrator to change permissions for your service users.Lastly the IAM administrator you write the policies to help manage who can access the VPC. 

One good way to manage who has access to what is authentication,this is how we sign into AWS. We can sign in as our AWS account root user, an IAM user, or by assuming the IAM role. You can also use your company’s single sign-on authentication. To sign into your aws root account use your root account email and password, when you first create an AWS account you get a single sign in identification this is your root this has all your access. We covered the basics of what IAM but there’s still much to learn !
